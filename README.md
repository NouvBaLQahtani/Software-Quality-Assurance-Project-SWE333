# LOCKIFY 
This project is part of the Software Quality Assurance course under my bachelor's degree in software engineering

## Introduction

LOCKIFY is an iOS application that aims to provide users with the ability to control, reserve, and check on their lockers. The application is designed to offer a seamless and secure locker management experience for its users.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of LOCKIFY is to develop a user-friendly and efficient application that simplifies the process of locker management, allowing users to easily reserve, access, and monitor their lockers.

## Quality Assurance Plan

The LOCKIFY project is committed to ensuring the quality of the application throughout the development process. The following sections outline the key aspects of the Quality Assurance (QA) plan:

### Project Scope

The QA plan covers the entire scope of the LOCKIFY project, including the development, testing, and deployment of the iOS application.

### General Constraints

The project is subject to the following general constraints:
- The system shall be available in English and Arabic.
- All scripts shall be written in Swift programming language.
- The system shall run under IOS platform and have the ability to transfer to
an Android platform.
- The System shall incorporate Apple Pay payment.

### Quality Goals

The primary quality goals for the LOCKIFY project are:
- Ensuring the functional correctness of the application, meeting all specified requirements.
- Providing a seamless and user-friendly experience for the end-users.
- Maintaining a high level of security and data privacy.
- Delivering a robust and reliable application with minimal defects.

### Planned Verification and Validation Tests

The LOCKIFY project will undergo a comprehensive set of verification and validation tests, including:
- Unit tests to validate the individual components of the application.
- Integration tests to ensure the seamless interaction between different modules.
- System tests to verify the overall functionality of the application.
- Acceptance tests to validate the application's compliance with the user requirements.

### Configuration Management

The project will implement a robust configuration management process to ensure the traceability and control of the codebase, artifacts, and documentation throughout the development lifecycle.

### Quality Assurance Process Metrics

The QA team will establish and monitor various quality metrics to measure the effectiveness of the QA processes, such as:
- Requirement Quality (RQ)
- Weighted Development Error Density (WDED)
- Code Reuse (CRe)
- Test Case Effectiveness (TCE)
- Weighted Software System Failure Density (WSSFD)

## Conclusion

The LOCKIFY Quality Assurance plan outlines the key activities, processes, and metrics that will be implemented to ensure the delivery of a high-quality iOS application. The plan aims to address the project's constraints, meet the defined quality goals, and provide a robust and secure locker management solution for the end-users.
